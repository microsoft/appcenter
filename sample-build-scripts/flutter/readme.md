# Flutter Build Scripts for App Center
Currently, Flutter is **not** supported by App Center. But these build scripts allow you to add custom functionality beyond the normal scope of that support. They are provided as-is and may be sufficient for your use case; but you might also encounter limitations that aren't immediately addressable by the App Center team. 

You can vote for Flutter support with a thumbs-up here: https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter/issues/67. It also has some discussion of common issues and possible workarounds users have found.
